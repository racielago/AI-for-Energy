A collection of **educational notebooks and scripts** that demonstrate the application of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)** techniques in the **energy and industrial sectors**.  

This repository is part of my research, teaching, and writing work, and serves as a reference for engineers, students, and professionals interested in exploring how AI can optimise energy systems and drive the transition to smarter, more sustainable industries. 

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Provide **clear, practical examples** of AI/ML algorithms applied to energy and industry.  
- Build a **didactic resource** for readers of my book, blog, and LinkedIn posts.  
- Show recruiters and collaborators my expertise in **AI + Energy applications**.
